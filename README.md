##What Exactly is Japanese Language?

##Some Tips from Advanced Japanese Group Members:
**"My advice to all beginners is to start reading things for adults right off the bat (just make sure you can copy past the text quickly), and drill kanji intensively in parallel, I got to reading adult stuff in just few months.  It will be slow as puck at the beginning, but in the speed will be increasing rapidly.  Learning to swim by jumping into sea :3"**

**"I like turtles."**
